The analysis of its free cash flow with the estimated revenue shows a positive NPV, whereas 25% reduction of revenue will lead to a negative NPV and a considerable decrease in IRR, especially lower than cost of capital. Smartphone market insights highlight the difficulties related to unexpected factors like war and inflationary pressures, severe competitive with the participants of both major and emerging companies, and high brand loyalty when approaching smartphone market. After analysing potential risks, the project is identified to start to suffer a financial loss when the revenue is 3% less than the proposed amount. Applying DEPEST, the study provides further information of economic, political, socio-cultural, demographics, and technological factors for the management team to consider the project’s possibility. Following those evaluation, HP company is recommended to invest in this project but should consider some potential risks can occur."
